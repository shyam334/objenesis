Here are multiple benchmark that are meant to verify Objenesis performances.

The source code is available [https://github.com/easymock/objenesis/tree/master/benchmark here] is you want to challenge it.

This benchmark compares two implementations working on HotSpot. We have also added and instantiation with the default constructor. You might notice it is quite slow compared to Objenesis.

The munged constructor version is using a special constructor HotSpot is using to perform serialization.

The unsafe version is using Unsafe.allocateInstance. A bit easier to implement in Objenesis but much slower than the munged version. So we kept the later one as the default for HotSpot.
