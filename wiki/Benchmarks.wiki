Here are multiple benchmark that are meant to verify Objenesis performances.

The source code is available [https://github.com/easymock/objenesis/tree/master/benchmark here] is you want to challenge it.

= Sum implementations (CreateObject) =

This benchmark compares two implementations working on HotSpot. They are instantiating the class Object. We have also added an instantiation with the default constructor.

The munged constructor version is using a special constructor HotSpot is using to perform serialization.

The unsafe version is using Unsafe.allocateInstance. A bit easier to implement in Objenesis but much slower than the munged version. So we kept the later one as the default for HotSpot.
