<p>Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>To instantiate a new object of a particular class.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>When would you want this?</h1>

<p>Java already supports this dynamic instantiation of classes using <code>Class.newInstance()</code>.
    However, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There are many times when a class
    cannot be instantiated this way, such as when the class contains:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Constructors that require arguments.</li>
    <li>Constructors that have side effects.</li>
    <li>Constructors that throw exceptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, it is common to see restrictions in libraries stating that classes must require a
    default constructor. Objenesis aims to overcomes these restrictions by bypassing the constructor on object
    instantiation.</p>

<h1>Typical uses</h1>

<p>Needing to instantiate an object without calling the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however
    there are certain cases when this is useful:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Serialization, Remoting and Persistence</strong>
        - Objects need to be instantiated and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects</strong>
        - Classes can be subclassed without needing to worry about the super() constructor.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Container Frameworks</strong>
        - Objects can be dynamically instantatiated in non-standard ways.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<ol>
    <li><a href="download.html">Download</a> objenesis-@VERSION@.jar.</li>
    <li>Read the <a href="tutorial.html">twenty second tutorial</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>Objenesis uses a variety of approaches to attempt to instantiate the object, depending on the type of object,
JVM version, JVM vendor and SecurityManager present. These are described in full in the
    <a href="details.html">detailed documentation</a>.</p>

<h1>Avoiding the Dependency</h1>

<p>For something as straight forward as instantiating an object, it can be a pain introducing yet another
    library dependency into your project. Objenesis is easy to <a href="embedding.html">embed in your
    existing library</a> so your end users don't even know it's there.</p>


<h1>Supported JVMs</h1>

<p>The list of tested JVMs is available <a href="http://code.google.com/p/objenesis/wiki/ListOfCurrentlySupportedVMs">here</a>. 
Other JVMs might be supported be haven't been tested yet. You can test your environment using the 
<a href="details.html#Test your environment">TCK</a> and we would be glad to have <a href="support.html">feedback</a>
on any supported / unsupported JVM.</p>
