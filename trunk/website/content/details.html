    <title>The Details</title>

<body>

<p>The <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial</a> allows you to perfectly use Objenesis.
However, if you want implementation details, tools and more power, you're at 
the right place.</p>

<h1>Test your environment</h1>

<p>Depending on you JVM and security manager, Objenesis might not be able to
instantiate some of your classes. If that's the case, first, we are highly
interested in <a href="support.html">knowing this limitation</a>.</p>

<p>Then, to prevent this, we provide a TCK to run in your environment. You can
find it in our <a href="download.html">download page</a>. It will print a report 
to the standard output. Exceptions, if they occur, will be printed out to
the standard error. Tests are run <code>ObjenesisStd</code> and <code>ObjenesisSerializer</code>
and are made of every kind of class types you might want to instantiate. So you can check if all
of them or at least the kind you want are correctly instantiated.</p>

<p>To launch from the command line, just type</p>
   
<pre>java -jar objenesis-@VERSION@-tck.jar</pre>

<p>Note that objenesis jar is bundled in the TCK so no special classpath is needed.</p>

<p>To launch from within an application server, the easiest is to bundle it in your application
and to call <code>org.objenesis.tck.Main.main()</code> from your code.</p>

<h1>Exception Handling</h1>

<em>TODO</em>
Exceptions if not serializable, failed to instantiate...

<h1>ObjectInstantiator caching</h1>

<p><a href="#">ObjenesisBase</a> provide a built-in cache that is activated by default. This
cache keeps ObjectInstantior instances per Class. This improves performance quite a lot when
the same Class is frequently instantiated. For this reason, it is recommended to reuse
Objenesis instances whenever posssibly or to keep is as a singleton in your favorite
dependency injection framework.</p>

<p>However, you can always disable the cache if needed</p>
<pre>
    Objenesis o = new ObjenesisStd(false); // cache disabled
</pre>

<p>The cache should behave correctly in an application server and not cause any memory leaks.</p>

<h1>Use you own strategy</h1>

<p>As you've seen in the <a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial</a>, Objenesis implementations
are determining the best instantiator using a strategy. It might occurs that you need
to implement your own strategy. Two possible reasons I can think of are that</p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>You want to specialize in a given JVM.</strong> Default strategies are
       supporting all JVMs. This has a little performance cost so you might want to
       provide a strategy that is optimized for your JVM.
<pre>
public class Sun14Strategy implements InstantiatorStrategy {
    public ObjectInstantiator newInstantiatorOf(Class type) {
        // return sun dedicated instantiator
        return new SunReflectionFactoryInstantiator(type);
    }
}
</pre></li>
    <li><strong>Objenesis doesn't support your environment by default.</strong> In that
        case, we would be really happy to add this support in our next version and
        meanwhile, you can use your own strategy and instantiator to fix this.</li>
</ul>

<p>From there, you can use this new strategy.</p>
<pre>
// Directly
Objenesis o = new ObjenesisBase(new Sun14Strategy());

// Or inside your Objenesis own implementation
public class ObjenesisSun14 extends ObjenesisBase {
    public ObjenesisSun14() {
       super(new Sun14Strategy());
    }
}
</pre>

<h1>The Evil ObjenesisHelper</h1>

<p>Static methods are considered a really bad practice. They can't be mocked or
replace easily. Worst, if the class keep a static state, you will fell in
class loading issues, memory leaks, module dependencies and so on. <strong>We 
strongly recommend you not to use them.</strong></p>

<p>However, if for some reason that we prefer ignore, you still want to use Objenesis
in a static way, you can do so. It's called <code>ObjenesisHelper</code>.</p>

<p>We prefer to provide it knowing that some of you will code it anyway. It a wrapper
over an <code>ObjenesisStd</code> and <code>ObjenesisSerializer</code> instance which
are kept statically.</p>

<p>It can't be more straightforward to use:</p>

<pre>
   Object o1 = ObjenesisHelper.newInstance(MyClass.class);
   Object o2 = ObjenesisHelper.newSerializableInstance(MyClass.class);
   ObjectInstantiator o3 = ObjenesisHelper.getInstantiatorOf(MyClass.class);
   ObjectInstantiator o4 = ObjenesisHelper.getSerializableObjectInstantiatorOf(MyClass.class);
</pre>
